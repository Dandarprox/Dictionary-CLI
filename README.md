# Dictionary CLI

## Motivation
Sometimes more than one dictionary can be a really good source of truth, having
the change of comparing several sources is even better, but searching in the web
in multiple sites at the time with different UI's can be a cumbersome task.

When we learn a language, vocabulary understanding is a must, this tool integrates
several web dictionaries using scrapping strategies that finally combine in a single
tool with an unified formatting.
